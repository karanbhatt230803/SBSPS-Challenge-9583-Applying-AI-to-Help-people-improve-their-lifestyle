| Description                  | Age-related diseases are killing 150,000 people per day. Humanity is a health tech organization, which is now able to monitor people’s rates of aging, but the only way for that information to have an impact is if the people can know what actions they should take to slow their aging down. This is complex because these impactful actions will not only be different for every person, but also for every moment in that person’s life, and for every combination of actions the person takes. The basic idea behind biological aging is that aging occurs as you gradually accumulate damage and lose function in various tissues and systems in the body. Biological age can vary quite a bit depending on your lifestyle (diet, exercise, sleep, attitude, stress, etc.). Depending on your genetics and your lifestyle actions, your biological age will be higher or lower than your chronological one. People with a younger biological age compared to their chronological age are at a lower risk of suffering age-related diseases and mortality.                  |
